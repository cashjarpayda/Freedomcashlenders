Another heavy hitter in the personal loan industry, Freedom Cash lenders sets itself apart with a very large lender network that works specifically with bad credit applicants. The platform doesn’t charge any fees (such as an origination fee) for its service.

You’re less likely to run into a payday lender or find a payday loan on the Freedom Cash lenders network because the company works with many different personal loan companies that offer a variety of installment loan options. You may find title loans, cash advance loans, and other types of emergency loan products to meet your repayment plan needs. The loan amount you can receive will vary depending on your credit history and income, though not every lender on the network requires a credit check.
